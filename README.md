movements over a specified period, called `data.csv` from the current working directory, and
print the average (mean) journey duration, across all bikes and all stations, for the reporting period, in
format `hh:mm:ss`.<br>

In order to run this script locally, you should have python3 installed on your machine. <br>
From the root directory (the same that contains app.py), open your terminal and run: `python3 app.py`
